<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p>
This section makes reference to the files in the /stats folder.
</p>

<h2>R Code</h2>
<p>
The dataAnalysis.r file contains the R code used to load and analyze the information obtained from the project code.
</p>

<h2>CSV Files</h2>
<p>
These are the files obtained from the project code with the features of the files listed.
</p>

<h3>EntrData.csv</h3>
<p>
Contains the basic statistics about the files and if it is a virus or not (Type).
The basic statistics are:
<ul>
  <li>File - Full file entropy</li>
  <li>Min - The entropy of the block with the lowest entropy.</li>
  <li>1Q - The first quartile of file blocks.</li>
  <li>Median - Guess</li>
  <li>Mean - Guess</li>
  <li>3Q - Guess</li>
  <li>Max - Guess</li>
  <li>Type - 0: if not a virus. 1: if the file is a virus.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>struct.csv</h3>
<p>Contains the features obtained from the mean change point analysis.<br>
The fetures in this file are:
<ul>
  <li>maxJumpSize</li>
  <li>minJumpSize</li>
  <li>maxLongestRunPct - The percent of the longest segment vs the sum of all segments.</li>
  <li>meanLongestRun - The mean entropy of the longest segment.</li>
  <li>Segment_Count - How many segments.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>alphaFT.csv</h3>
<p>Has the features extracted from the Detrended fluctuation and Fourier transform Analysis.<br>
The fetures in this file are:
<ul>
  <li>Alpha - The DFA statistic.</li>
  <li>MagN - The magnitude of Nth "freqency" </li>
  <li>RatioN - The ratio MagN/Mag0</li>
  <li>Pitch - The Harmonic with the highest magnitude</li>
</ul>
</p>
